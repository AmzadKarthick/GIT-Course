Summary: Branches with GitHub
  In this module, you learned that:

  A branch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make changes. 

  In the child branch, you can build, make edits, test the changes, and then merge them with the main branch. 

  To ensure that changes are made by one member, do not impede or affect the workflow of other members, multiple branches can be created and merged with the main branch.

  A pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits made to the main branch.
